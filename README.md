# small-doge

* This project aims to train a series of dynamic and fast small models from scratch, with the fastest training time of only 3 hours! You can train a tiny language model [Doge-20M](https://huggingface.co/SmallDoge/Doge-20M) in just 13M!üöÄ
* The small doge series is extremely lightweight, with the smallest version being about **$\frac{1}{7800}$** the size of GPT3, and strives to make even the most ordinary personal GPU capable of fast inference and even training.üèéÔ∏è
* We provide full-stage code for dataset preprocessing, pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning preference alignment, visual multimodal VLM (under development), and inference fine-tuning R1 (under development).üß™
* Standing on the shoulders of giants can see further, we hope that the small doge series of small models can provide researchers with more ideas and contribute to the road to achieving **Embodied Artificial General Intelligence**.ü§ñ

  > [!TIP]
  > We hope to use open-source tools and frameworks as much as possible to simplify the process from data processing to model training, so that beginners can easily understand and use.ü§ó

## About

This project aims to develop a series of dynamic and fast small models to promote their application in the field of embodied intelligence, especially in resource-constrained environments, to meet real-time response needs, and to promote the practical application of downstream fields.

> [!TIP]
> *As of 2025-2-2*: The small doge series has completed the pre-training of 2 model models, with a minimum of 20M, which can have smooth conversation capabilities!

| Model | tokens | max_train_steps | accumulate_steps | learning_rate | scheduler | warmup_ratio | decay_ratio | weight_decay | min_lr_rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Doge-20M | 4B | 8,000 | 256 | 8e-3 | warmup_stable_decay | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.01 | 0.0 |
| Doge-60M | 16B | 16,000 | 512 | 6e-3 | warmup_stable_decay | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.01 | 0.0 | |

> The following two models are currently in pre-training, and researchers with the capability are welcome to help(poor man's cry)!üôè

As shown in the figure, the sequence transformation part of the Doge architecture uses `Dynamic Mask Attention`, which can be understood as using self-attention related to value states during training, and using state-space without past state decay during inference, to solve the problem of existing Transformers or SSMs getting lost in long text. The state transformation part of Doge uses `Cross Domain Mixture of Experts`, which consists of dense linear layers and sparse embedding layers, and can additionally increase sparse parameters to continue training from dense weight checkpoints without retraining the entire model, thereby reducing the cost of continuous iteration of the model. In addition, Doge also uses `RMSNorm` and `Residual` with learnable parameters to adapt the gradient range of deep models.

## Requirements

Our codebase requires the following environment:

- Windows or Linux
- NVIDIA GPU
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA 11.8+

We highly recommend that you install the latest version of PyTorch and CUDA for optimal performance.

Of course, you can also use the open-source [Docker PyTorch](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) image to avoid the hassle of configuring the environment.

```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.12-py3
docker run --privileged --gpus all -it --name PyTorch --shm-size=32g -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 -v <your code path>:/workspace -v <your datasets path>:/workspace/Doge/datasets nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.12-py3
```

- `pip install transformers`: The core framework for all subsequent work.
- `pip install datasets sentencepiece boto3`: Used to download and process datasets.
- `pip install accelerate`: Used for distributed training.
- `pip install trl`: Used for fine-tuning with reinforcement learning.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmallDoges/small-doge.git
cd small-doge
pip install -e .
```


## Quick Start

We have written a [notebook](./examples/notebook.ipynb) and a [training guide](./recipes/doge/README.md) to demonstrate the entire process of dataset processing, model training, and model evaluation. You can also use the models that have been released independently. If you are interested, please read the notebook or training guide in detail, which contains specific steps and details!


## Models Released

### Doge-CheckPoint

![wsd_scheduler](./assets/wsd_scheduler.png)

Doge uses `wsd_scheduler` as the training scheduler, which divides the learning rate into three stages: `warmup`, `stable`, and `decay`. It allows us to continue training on any new dataset from any checkpoint in the `stable stage` without spikes of the training.

Here are the initial learning rates required to continue training at each checkpoint:

- **[Doge-20M](https://huggingface.co/SmallDoge/Doge-20M-checkpoint)**: 8e-3
- **[Doge-60M](https://huggingface.co/SmallDoge/Doge-60M-checkpoint)**: 6e-3
- **[Doge-160M](https://huggingface.co/SmallDoge/Doge-160M-checkpoint)**: 4e-3
- **Doge-320M**: 2e-3

| Model | Learning Rate | Schedule | Warmup Steps | Stable Steps |
|-------|---------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| [Doge-20M]((https://huggingface.co/SmallDoge/Doge-20M-checkpoint)) | 8e-3 | wsd_scheduler | 800 | 6400 |
| [Doge-60M](https://huggingface.co/SmallDoge/Doge-60M-checkpoint) | 6e-3 | wsd_scheduler | 1600 | 12800 |
| [Doge-160M](https://huggingface.co/SmallDoge/Doge-160M-checkpoint) | 4e-3 | wsd_scheduler | 2400 | 19200 |
| Doge-320M | 2e-3 | wsd_scheduler | 3200 | 25600 ||
